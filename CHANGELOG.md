# Changelog

The first release is v0.1.0 (its heading carries no date until the tag is cut).
Entries are written for someone deciding whether to bump: what changed for
them, and for anything breaking, what to do.

## v0.1.0

- The provider-neutral cluster contract (`pkg/cluster`): `Outputs` (name,
  endpoint, certificate authority, OIDC issuer, capabilities), the six
  capabilities (node pools, storage, network policy, workload identity, load
  balancing, API access) and `Outputs.Validate`, which refuses an outputs
  value a consumer could not safely use and reports every problem at once.
- No provider components yet. EKS Auto Mode comes first, self-hosted Talos
  second; each is a separate entry here when it lands.
